   <h2>11-year veteran cornerback Antonio Cromartie retires</h2>
   <p>Veteran cornerback Antonio Cromartie announced his retirement from the NFL on Monday.
      The 11-year pro with four franchises posted a message on Instagram saying 
      “after 27 years of playing football, today I say farewell.”
      An All-Pro with San Diego in 2007, when he led the league with 10 interceptions, Cromartie 
      was one of the NFL’s best cover cornerbacks for much of his career, making four Pro Bowls. 
      He also scored the longest touchdown in league history, returning a missed field goal by Minnesota for a 109-yard score in 2007.</p>
