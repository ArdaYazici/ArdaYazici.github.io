 <h3>Will this product succeed?</h3>
 <p>I don't think there are enough rich people who are also gamers who would invest more than <span style="color:green">CAD $3000</span> on a laptop when you could buy a desktop pc that is better for cheaper. But on the other hand there are going to be some people who travel alot and are rich who can't carry a desktop computer around with them so they could invest into this laptop, for example a famous gaming youtuber who travels around the world would need something like this not only to play games but also to edit their youtube videos after recording it. I think this laptop will be bought enough to cover the cost. In other words it will be profitable, successful, and useful for many or may be the exact opposite.</p>
